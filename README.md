# Real Estate Price Prediction
This project aims at predicting the house prices in Bangalore using a Machine Learning model. 
We take the dataset from Kaggle and apply Linear Regression from sklearn to predict the prices.
We then write a python flask server to take in http requests using the saved model.
We finally build a website using HTML, CSS and Javascript that allows us to enter the various specifications of a house and it then retrieves the price by calling the python flask server.
The various tools used in this project are:
1. Python
2. Numpy and Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Sklearn
5. Flask
6. HTML, CSS & Javascript for UI
7. Jupyter Notebook, VS Code & Python IDLE as IDE
